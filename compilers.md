#  An Introduction to Compilers For Morons (By a Complete Moron(Like a Serious Moron))
  
## What The Fuck is a Compiler!?!?!? 

  - NOTE A program for a computer must be built by combining these simple commands, this is refering to the simple 
    commands that are executed in order to reduce the complexity of building and desinging computers. combining these simple comands into a program is what is called MACHINE LANGUAGE

  - High level programming is used to avoid tedious and  the error prone process of programming
    - This language can be very different from the MACHINE LANGUAGE that the computer can execute, this is where that damn compiler comes in handy
